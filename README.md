# Flask Market
<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Oleksandr <img src="https://github.com/blackcater/blackcater/raw/main/images/Hi.gif" height="32"/></h1>
That's my first Flask and HTML/CSS experiance.

I have completed my first web project where You can navigate through different tabs of the store and see the gadgets in different categories

The application is a practice of basic knowledge. Therefore, it hasn't more any functionality.
The error is that the data is not taken from the database. Despite the fact that models and tables were built, I failed to build a connection between the database and the application for the first time. Therefore, the data enters the HTML file directly, returning to the functions through the render_template as an array of dictionaries.
With the current knowledge, I can easily fix this problem and diversify the site with the necessary functionality.
